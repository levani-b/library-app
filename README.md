# [Library App](https://library-app-levanib.vercel.app)

A personal library tracker built as part of my JavaScript learning journey. This project reinforced my understanding of core JavaScript concepts through practical implementation.

- **DOM Manipulation**: Built dynamic UI elements and handled user interactions
- **Local Storage**: Implemented data persistence for saving library data
- **Event Handling**: Managed various user events (add, remove, toggle read status)
- **Array Methods**: Used array operations for managing the book collection
- **Responsive Design**: Created a mobile-friendly layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
